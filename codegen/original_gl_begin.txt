Interesting. There's a table of function pointers at EAX:
    mov eax,dword ptr fs:[18]

At offset 0x7cc, we get a pointer to atioglxx.dll's implementation of glBegin.
    mov esi,dword ptr ds:[eax+7CC] 
    ...
    call esi 

Why not just hook by changing the function pointer?

"...Which is almost exactly the same code as in opengl32.dll suggesting that both are just jumping to a function pointer from a table...
I don't know enough ASM to know what large fs:18h points to but maybe if I can find this table of pointers I can add my hooks in there?"

Curious.
